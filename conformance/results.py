    """Build the ``certificationEligibility`` block for the result file.

    Implements the PRD's Certification Eligibility Assessment for Phase 1: a
    self-service check that a run is suitable for submission to OBL for
    formal certification. The criteria are driven by which steps were
    declared ``mandatory`` in the manifest — *not* hardcoded — so OBL
    Standards can adjust mandatory coverage by editing configuration.

    Eligibility rules:
        * A run is eligible only when at least one mandatory step ran *and*
          every mandatory step finished as ``passed`` or ``warn``.
        * ``warn`` is non-blocking (PRD: warnings *"do not block
          certification"*).
        * ``failed`` and ``skipped`` on a mandatory step block eligibility.
          ``skipped`` always implies an earlier failure, so it is treated as
          blocking by definition.
        * Deselecting a mandatory step from the test plan also blocks
          eligibility and takes precedence over every other reason — a run
          that never executed a mandatory step cannot demonstrate coverage
          of it, regardless of why.
        * A run with no mandatory steps cannot certify — the PRD
          requires *"all mandatory tests were included in the run"*, so
          zero mandatory steps is treated as "not a certification
          candidate". This applies equally to manifest runs that declare
          no mandatory steps and to non-manifest smoke checks (which have
          no mandatory concept at all).

    The block intentionally does *not* yet check "FCS version is an approved
    release". That criterion is the CertificationValidator's job (OBL-side,
    not participant-side) and the approved-release list is not yet wired
    through to the engine.

    Args:
        steps: Ordered step results from the smoke-check run.
        deselected_mandatory_step_ids: Ids of manifest steps that were
            declared mandatory but deselected from the plan. Sourced from
            :meth:`TestPlan.deselected_mandatory_step_ids`. Empty when
            no plan was supplied to :func:`build_smoke_check_result`.

        mandatory counts, ``mandatoryDeselected`` count and
        ``mandatoryDeselectedStepIds`` list, and a ``reason`` string when
